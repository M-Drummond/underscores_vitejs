People often ask about this setup.  Underscores is a classic WP boilerplate theme, that's nice and unopinionated.  We enhance this with a stack of opinions and the very modern vitejs toolchain.  You'll need to install WP yourself.  Includes TailwindCSS and some other niceties.

# Setup

* npm install
* npm run build or npm run dev

# FAQ
> I get an error when the frontend tries to load the app js

Visit the URL that's failing to load and make sure your browser is allowing it access.

> Why underscores

It's really fast, and very easy to work with.  TailwindCSS slots right in to the theme, and there's not much in the way of junk JS to remove.
